title: "Outside of Work"

I grew up in St. Louis, MO as the oldest of five. Outside of work, a few of my hobbies include playing pick-up soccer, working out, and spending time with my wife and family. Recently, I've picked up tennis and pickleball. Here are a few photos from recent trips to India and Spain.
